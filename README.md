This repository contains the slides and R markdown programs for my historcal borrowing short course at 28th Biopharmaceutical Applied Statistics Symposium (BASS XXVIII). 

GitHub markdown works differently with R markdown, and therefore math equations cannot be displayed properly on GitHub. You need to download the .Rmd files and knit by yourself. Alternatively, rendered PDF files are available.
